# HIERARCHICAL-CLUSTERING
Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning algorithms so there is no label associated with data points. Clustering algorithms look for similarities or dissimilarities among data points so that similar ones can be grouped together.  Hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:  Agglomerative : This is a "bottom-up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.  Divisive : This is a "top-down" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.
